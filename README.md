# Hello, Rifa Prasetya here..!

This time I made a simple game again.
In this project I made a Snake Game. Of course, using javascript.
To be honest, I was a bit dissatisfied with the results. However, I realized that my abilities were not yet sufficient to achieve the Snake Game that I wanted. Sorry, I showed you a bad project...
This is the alpha version of the snake game I coded.
That's enough, thank you and see you again...!

## I want this projectðŸ§¸

Step by step:

1. Clone this repository into your personal computer
2. Open directory
3. Run html file in browser (i'm prefent you to use Chrome)
4. And now you can play the Snake Game. Have fun!
